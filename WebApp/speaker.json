In the Bay Area, multiple hackathons are held weekly and offer a great place to meet new people and build out an idea you have been thinking about for awhile but never had the time to actually do it!\n\nJeanCarl will talk about the process he uses to take an idea to a functioning prototype in 24 hours. Topics include: finding the talent, ideation, choosing the technology stack, planning the stages of development, working in a team environment, modularization, pitching the prototype, winning prizes, and going to market. \n\nAttendees will learn about pitfalls throughout the process and gain an appreciation of how you can take an idea to market via a hackathon. This session is designed for everyone, no coding experience required.",

Businesses realize that data and the business intelligence gained from it is one of the most valuable assets it possesses. Consequently data has migrated from vertical big iron systems to distributed horizontally scaleable systems with the potential for massive parallel processing. \n\nAnd that is not all. Data systems, once used for MapReduce and long running batch processing are now processing data at near real time. The innovations in this area are foundational and seismic. Newer data systems will provide personalization, recommendations, business insights in near real time.\n\nHowever, building, maintaining and managing these systems is non-trivial. There is a paradigm shift when dealing with distributed and partitioned data: how do we provide a consistent view of the distributed data; how do we maintain 24/7 availability; and how do we handle unexpected failures - and failures are always unexpected.\n\nThis talk goes into some of the principles and practices in distributed data systems, from messaging systems like Kafka to in-memory file systems and distributed caches. And it suggests best of breed practices to apply when building your own distributed system.\n\n",

You'll get insight to about what to learn in Angular 1.x versus Angular 2.0 (and the cluster of related technologies), and when it's advisable to learn about both, and also other technologies will help you learn AngularJS.\n\nThe success of AngularJS is described as \"a runaway locomotive\", perhaps partly because AngularJS \"plays well\" with other toolkits/libraries (e.g., BackboneJS, D3.js, and Polymer for custom components). AngularJS 2.x is also part of the \"MEAN\" stack (bonus points if you know this acronym) for Web app development. At the same time, it's important to be aware of the criticism that AngularJS has received (not just \"the good parts\"), and how those issues are addressed in Angular2.x.\n\nWe'll look at some AngularJS 2.x code samples using TypeScript (think classes, interfaces, and strongly typed variables), and some tips for writing AngularJS 2.x apps. This session is also helpful for the second session that delves into Web Components (and Polymer and more about AngularJS 2.x). If time permits, we can look at a fun example of using D3 in AngularJS, and AngularJS+SVG graphics on Google Glass (is that thing still alive???)\n\nWe'll wrap up with a raffle of some recent books: a Python Pocket Primer, a D3.js Pocket Primer, and another upcoming book.\n",

It can do everything Java, C/C++/C#, Ruby, PHP, and Perl can do, but it's also fun & intuitive! Enjoy coding as fast as you think with a simple yet robust syntax that encourages group collaboration. It is known for several popular web frameworks, including Django (Python's equivalent to Ruby on Rails), Pyramid, and web2py. There is also Google App Engine, where Python was the first supported runtime. Users supporting Zope, Plone, Trac, and Mailman will also benefit from knowing some Python. Besides the Web, Python can do text processing (JSON, CSV, XML), databases (SQL, NoSQL), GUIs, data science/Big Data, math/numeric/scientific processing, Internet client/server systems & networking, GIS/ESRI, QA/test tools, automation frameworks, control Microsoft Office applications, and system administration tasks!\n<p></p>\nOn the education front, it's a great tool to teach programming with (especially those who have done Scratch or Tynker already) as well as a solid (first) language to learn for non-programmers and other technical staff. Finally, if Python doesn't do what you want, you can extend it in C/C++, Java, or C# (even VB.NET)!

Unlike traditional servers, NGINX doesn’t rely on threads to handle requests. Instead it uses a much more scalable event-driven (asynchronous) architecture. This architecture uses small, but more importantly, predictable amounts of memory under load. Even if you don’t expect to handle thousands of simultaneous requests, you can still benefit from NGINX’s high-performance and small memory footprint. NGINX scales in all directions: from the smallest VPS all the way up to large clusters of servers.</p>",

The users will benefit of a lot more flexibility and design freedom.\n \nSo, we decided to integrate this feature in 4D Studio and do some user testing. We provided documentation and samples,  it went very well for people who knew coding and javascript. But still, for the others it was frustrating. We wanted to enable scripting for them too, so we studied various graphical languages and how we could integrate them.\n\nI will present how we evaluated the various options for graphical language: flow programming versus sequential programming. I will detail the pro and cons from a integration pov. \n\nTo solve this problem, we ultimately picked Blockly. I will show you how we integrated this graphical language to write augmented reality scripts. Building your own interactive 4d project has never been easier!\n",

Native apps, written in Obj-C, Swift, or Java, give you great performance and full access to the platform's APIs. However, you need to write separate apps for each platform. Cross-platform apps, typically written in JavaScript, let you easily run on multiple operating systems. However, it's tricky using 100% of the native platform's APIs, and performance sometimes suffers.\n\nEnter Xamarin. Xamarin apps run with native performance, can use 100% of each platform's APIs, and provide significant code sharing across platforms. Xamarin apps are written in C# or F#, and benefit from the enormous .NET developer ecosystem. Xamarin development can be done on both Mac and Windows.\n\nThis talk will be an overview of Xamarin's various components followed by a deeper dive in to Xamarin.Forms. With Xamarin.Forms, you can write cross-platform user interfaces using XAML.\n\nIf you optionally want a free T-shirt, bring your laptop with Xamarin already installed. Download it from http://xamarin.com. Mac users should also come with Xcode already installed. Download it from the Mac App Store. Mac users can use the iOS Simulator which comes with Xcode. Windows users will have to either bring an Android phone with a USB cable, or install an Android emulator. Download the Xamarin Android Player, or use the VS2015 Emulator for Android.

High performing teams are not only a joy to be part of, but also highly effective at delivering products that delight customers. </p>\n\n<p>The 2012 Study of Product Team Performance revealed five practices that, if product teams are doing them, gives them a 67% likelihood of achieving high team performance. (Similarly, if they practice none of them, they'll have a miniscule 2% likelihood of achieving high team performance!). </p>\n\n<p>The 2013 Study revealed rapid growth in the number of teams becoming agile - and fascinating insight into development methods and practices teams believe improve their products' profitability. </p>\n\n<p>This year we discovered the correlation with standups. (Make them effective, hold them daily.) And with tightly integrating user experience. </p><p>Study co-author Ron Lichty will present the insights we gained from the 2015 Study of Product Team Performance - as well as key findings from earlier studies. </p>\n\n<p>Join us and learn where you can focus to take your product team to awesome.</p>",

And agile, done well, means every one of us engages in the crafting of it.\n\nIn addition to training teams in agile, Ron Lichty has spent years coaching managers about how their roles change with agile. While his recent Addison Wesley book, <i>Managing the Unmanageable: Rules, Tools, and Insights for Managing Software People and Teams</i>, didn’t zero in on agile, both the book and the classes that he and his coauthor give current and prospective managers espouse a deeply agile mindset for managers.\n",

The Actor Model (conceived back in 1973) is a high level abstraction for writing concurrent and distributed applications. The core concept of \"actors\" alleviates the developer from having to deal with explicit locking and thread management, making it easier to write correct concurrent systems. \n\nAkka.NET is an implementation of the Actor Model and a port of the Akka framework, that has been around on the JVM for a few years.\n\nIn this session I will give an overview of the Actor Model; what Actors are, how they interact with messages and why they are inherently good at solving concurrent programming problems. I will cover concepts such as supervision and why this provides clean semantics for fault-tolerance and leads to systems that can self heal. In the second half, I will dive in to some code to demonstrate some of these concepts in a program implemented with Akka.NET.\n\nAfter this session I hope that you will have good understanding of the Actor Model and why you would want use it in your concurrent, parallel and distributed systems.",

Play a game.\n• As kids get excited, unlock tokens like carrot, puddle, fence to teach conditionals (if/then/else), jump, strategy and play an intermediate level game. Play a game.\n• Next, introduce advance cards for learning iteration (loop/repeat) and function. Provide overview on how advanced card could be used to learn these concepts.\n• Finally, present other ways kids may learn programming fundamental with this simple board game (including dice fun, open play).\n\nKid while playing a board game and having fun would learn concepts on:\n• Sequence and Strategy\n• Conditionals if  <>  then <> else <>\n• Debugging\n• Iterations(loops) and Repeat\n• Functions\n\nThis is not a session for intermediate or advance Scratch or Tynker kids, but for young beginners who are getting introduced to coding.

Data Distribution Service (DDS) is the platform for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). It offers real-time, peer-to-peer, standard, data-centric publish subscribe. With DDSConnector you can now exploit the power of DDS within node.js without having to deal with complex APIs. Define your data types, your data writers, data readers and desired quality of service in a XML file and simply load it in your node.js application. Your applications will effortlessly become participants in a logically shared, but decentralized peer-to-peer data-space with other applications over a LAN or WAN.  \n\nDDS is an open real-time connectivity framework standard that has proven itself in industrial systems for building highly reliable systems that can be trusted without a single point of failure, and as a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture with no message servers or brokers. If you need a connectivity framework that is fast, that can scale to hundreds of nodes, that is monitorable and robust, and if your system has to last, adapt to new technologies, work in heterogeneous environments or connect to legacy systems, DDS is the answer. If you have to do all that in node.js DDSConnector is your answer. \n\nWe will cover the basics  of DDS with some practical examples and then dive in a few demos on how to use DDS in node.js through DDSConnector. \n",

Sound planning to store and manage your data sets goes long way in providing strong foundation for your app. Modeling is key.\nData modeling techniques  capture and translate complex system designs into easily understood representations of the data flows and processes, creating a blueprint for construction and/or re-engineering. Data modelers often use multiple models to view the same data and ensure that all processes, entities, relationships and data flows have been identified. There are several different approaches to data modeling, including:\nConceptual Data Modeling - identifies the highest-level relationships between different entities.\nEnterprise Data Modeling - similar to conceptual data modeling, but addresses the unique requirements of a specific business.\nLogical Data Modeling - illustrates the specific entities, attributes and relationships involved in a business function. Serves as the basis for the creation of the physical data model.\n\nin this session, based on above fundamentals, let us learn more about how we model for NoSQL big data storage engines like MongoDB, Cassandra and Hbase which  touch most big data apps today. You will learn row key and index designs. We will cover an app development and deployment at scale. We will go over  an example on how we enable a developer change data model on fly and deliver new feature for the app. ",

Users want both, but sometimes the interplay between design and performance feels like a fixed sum game: one side's gain is the other side's loss. Design and performance are indeed connected, but it's more like the yin and yang. They aren't opposing forces, but instead complement each other. Users want an experience that is rich and fast. The trick for designers and developers is figuring out how to do that.</p>\n\n<p>The answer is to adopt an approach that considers both design and performance from the outset. With this approach, designs are conceived by teams of designers and developers working together. Developers benefit by participating in the product definition process. Designers benefit from understanding more about how designs are implemented. There's an emphasis on early prototyping and tracking performance from the get go.</p>\n\n      <p>With new metrics that focus on what a user actually sees as the page loads, we can now bridge the technical and language gaps that have hindered the seamless creation of great user experiences.

Web applications are no longer being built to cater to human interaction, but now must adapt to be able to handle machine-to-machine communications. This new requirement has placed a dramatic emphasis on API interfaces and has even ushered in a new development methodology called API first development.\n\nAs a result, JavaScript has risen to the forefront as the ideal language due to its ability to perform under the high concurrency and event-driven I/O required by the multitude of devices being integrated onto the web. This rise in relevancy for JavaScript has, in turn, created a number of technologies that span the entire web application stack to provide the ideal platform to build the next generation of Web 3.0 applications. This web application stack is commonly referred to as the M.E.A.N stack and is more than just another web application framework. It is an answer to the glaring problem of web applications needing to support high concurrency requests from a multitude of devices, and serves as the ideal platform for what is being called Web 3.0.\n\nThis presentation will walk you through all the latest trends within Web Development and provide an in-depth introduction to the M.E.A.N architecture.

However, I've always been frustrated with manual test generation, which is tedious and time consuming. Failing to find a good solution, I created a tool called TestScribe to address this problem.\n\nTestScribe lets developers focus on choosing inputs and interpreting outputs, taking repetitive work out of the testing process. It makes developers' lives easier without sacrificing the fun of designing test cases.\n\nI will demonstrate how the tool works, share my experience using the tool and answer questions.",
